</TD>
</TR></TABLE>

In this shot of the opening screen, all of the default options are active.
<P>
Tetromix generally responds to both the mouse and the keyboard. When
you start the game you should see a gameplay demo in the center of the screen
and the Main Menu to the left. You can use the arrow
keys to navigate up and down. Pressing enter or clicking with the
mouse on one of the options will either bring up a selection submenu,
start an actual game, or quit the program, as appropriate.
  <P>
The submenus allow you to modify your playing environment.  Currently,
  you can select from different <A HREF="#color"><B>Color
  Styles</B></A>, <A HREF="#sound"><B>Sound Styles</B></A>, <A
  HREF="#piece"><B>Piece Styles</B></A>, and <A HREF="#games"><B>Game
  Types</B></A>.
The current value for each option is displayed in the main menu.
<P>
You can also select the <A HREF="#special"><B>Special Options</B></A>
submenu, which contains a set of toggles for special effects.
<P>
Each time you modify one of these options, the demo game will restart
  using your new preferences (so you can get a preview of what they
  look like without actually playing a game). Also, every time the
  demo game restarts it will choose a new computer "personality" (AI
  player).

<A NAME="howto">
<B>2. How to...</B>
<P>
This section describes how to perform basic actions (like running the
game and controlling falling pieces). 
<P>
<A NAME="run">
<B>2.1 Run tetromix</B>
<P>
Under Linux, you can usually run tetromix from the command prompt:
<PRE>
	your_machine$ tetromix
</PRE>
If you installed tetromix (via your package manager or "make install"), that should work
(tetromix will probably be in "/usr/bin/"). If you downloaded the source and
just compiled it, you must change to the top-level directory of the source
distribution to run it:
<PRE>
	your_machine$ cd /usr/src/tetromix-0.1
	your_machine$ ./tetromix
</PRE>
The RPM version of tetromix claims to add links for Gnome and KDE desktops,
but we haven't tested them. 
<P>
Under Windows, you can also run tetromix from the command prompt:
<PRE>
	C:\Program Files\tetromix\> tetromix.exe
</PRE>
... or by clicking on it via Windows Explorer or somesuch. Note that in any
event, tetromix looks for its game files both in the current directory and in
a distribution directory (usually /usr/games/tetromix/ or
C:\Program&nbsp;Files\tetromix\). If it exits shortly after starting up, make
sure those game files are available to it and try running it by hand in the
right directory.

<TR> <TD VALIGN=CENTER>
The object of the game is to clear all of the initial "garbage" from the bottom of the screen. One at a time,
randomly chosen pieces will fall from 
the top center of the board. You can guide them left and right and also
rotate them. Eventually they will settle near the bottom. Whenever you
completely fill an entire row (that's horizontal!) it disappears and the
pieces above it <A HREF="#gravity">fall down</A> to fill the
void. Generally there is some sort of 
time limit. Eventually, if you keep succeeding, you will advance to the
next "level": at higher levels there is more garbage and the pieces fall
faster (so you have less time to think).

If you are the only person at your keyboard, you can use either (or both)
sets of keys. If you are playing with two players at one keyboard, the
player on the left uses "wasd" and the player on the right uses the arrow
keys.

<TABLE CELLPADDING=3><TR>
<TD VALIGN=CENTER>
All of the menus in Tetromix are "radio menus" in the sense that
only one item from the menu can be selected at any one time. If there are
multiple menus visible on the screen, the currently active one will have a
light border around it. The current selection in each menu will be
highlighted as well. In this shot of the opening
screen, the menu on the right is the active one and "Solo
Normal Game" is the currently selected menu item. 
<P>
Use the up and down arrow keys to change the selected item in the current
menu. Press enter to confirm your selection and move on. You may also just
click on your desired choice.  Menus may contain more options than can
  be displayed simultaneously.  There is no actual way to tell that
  this is happening (sorry!).  If this is the case, you should use
  the arrow keys to scroll.
<P>
If more than one menu is available, you may use the left and right arrow
keys to change which menu is selected. Then use the up and down arrows to
choose something from that new menu. Or you can just click with the mouse.

  <TD>In this mode, you and a friend both have identical versions of 
      Tetromix running on two different computers that can
      reach each other via TCP/IP. We have not tested this over
      modem-speed connections: I recommend 10baseT or better LANs. You
      must determine beforehand who will be the "server" and who will
      be the "client". The client must know the hostname (or IP
      address) of the server. Both players must choose color styles with
      the same number of colors (but they may choose different styles) and
      piece styles with the same number of shape (if you do not, the
      game will issue a warning). Both players will receive identical
      garbage and falling pieces. The game plays just like "2 Players, 1
      Keyboard" except that you see less frequent updates of your
      opponent's progress on the right. After each level, the player
      running the server gets to choose when the next level starts, so the
      client must be ready!

  <TD>In this mode, you pick two AI personalities and watch them duel
      with each other (as in all of the other multi-player variants
      above). This is mostly useful because it allows you to pick up
      on strategy by watching the AI: it often does really stupid
      things which you should avoid and it often does really clever
      "look-ahead" type things which you should strive to emulate.

<A NAME="config">
<B>3. Configuration</B>
<P>
Tetromix is highly configurable.  It supports a variety of styles
for the game's pieces (in color and shape) and the game sounds. 
<P>
<A NAME="color">
<B>3.1 Color styles</B>
<P>
You can stick with the "Default Color Scheme" or you can switch to one of
our pre-made color schemes (e.g., "Deep Blue" or "Textures"). Color styles
just change the way in which the game's pieces are drawn: they do not
affect game mechanics in any way. [ Note, however, that the "all blue" and
"all grey" styles make for a more difficult game for human players because
the different colors look similar, although not identical. ]
<P>

You can also create your own color styles with your own graphics (no need
to recompile!) ... more on that <A HREF="#create">later</A>. 
<P>

<A NAME="sound">
<B>3.2 Sound styles</B>
<P>
You can stick with the "Default Sound Style", which includes pretty
standard bells and whistles for thudding pieces, clearing rows, and level
changes. You can also pick "No Sound", which blesses you with silence.
If you specify <B>-q</B> on the command line, "No Sound" will be the
only available choice. A
few other themes are provided. When you choose a new sound style, all of
the associated sounds are played in sequence so that you can get a feel for
them. 
<P>

You can also create your own sound styles if you have some WAV files lying
around (without recompiling!) ... more on that <A HREF="#create">later</A>. 
<P>

<A NAME="shape">
<B>3.3 Shape styles</B>
<P>
You can stick with the "Default Tetrominoes" (i.e., the planar shapes
made out of 4 blocks) or you can try for something more exciting. As math fans, we
like the planar pentominoes here (they have an "area" of 5
instead of 4), so you can play with them exclusively (hard!) or with all of
the different pieces that can be made up of 1-5 units. 
<P>

The other shape styles look difficult at first but they can be a lot of
fun, especially if you're getting bored with standard tetrominoes. 
<P>

In an incredible surprise move, you can create your own shape styles as
well. See <A HREF="#create">below</A>. 
<P>

<A NAME="special">
<B>3.4 Special options</B>
<P>
Special options control certain specific characteristics of the game's
mechanics and appearance. They are listed under the Special Options submenu.
Clicking (or pressing return) on a special option toggles its value. 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Toggle Fullscreen</B> allows you to switch back and forth
      from window-mode to full-screen mode while running the game. This
      only works on some platforms. Note that you can (try to) start in
      fullscreen mode by using the "-f" option.
  <LI><B>Background Flame</B> toggles whether or not you get the
      animated flames in the background. Turning this off will
      leave whatever flames you currently have static and significantly
      decrease the tetromix CPU demand.
  <LI><B>Power Pieces</B> toggles whether or not you can receive
      some of our <A HREF="#power">power pieces</A>
      (incorporated by special request). 
  <LI><B>Double Difficulty</B> requests the amount of garbage and the speed
	with which pieces fall to increase with every level. With <B>Double
	Difficulty</B> turned off, each increase in level alternates
	between increasing the speed of falling pieces and increasing the
	amount of garbage. Network players must both have the same value
	for this option.
  <LI><B>Long Settle Delay</B> doubles the amount of time you have to react
	after a piece settles but before it "locks in". If you attempt to
	make a valid move or rotation within that small window, the piece
	will move and the window will be reset, allowing you to slide the
	piece along even after it has apparently landed. This option
	changes the settle delay from 0.2 seconds to 0.4 seconds. 
  <LI><B>Upward Rotation</B> allows the game to consider moving your piece
	upward when determining if a rotation is possible. If you have
	nimble fingers, this option will allow you to hold off settling
	indefinitely with many pieces or to "walk" pieces across vast
	stretches of terrain. Since this affects the game balance, both
	network players must have the same value for this option.
</UL>

<A HREF="#top">Table of Contents</A>
<HR>

<A NAME="concepts">
<B>4. Game concepts</B>
<P>
This section details differences between Tetromix and other similar "falling pieces" games.
<P>

<A NAME="gravity">
<B>4.1 Color gravity</B>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Atris-ColorGravity1.jpg" HSPACE=10>
Unlike most such games, in this variant a single piece can be made up
of tiles of two different colors. For example, the "L" piece could
look like the figure on the left.
<P>

When the piece finally "touches down" on some other pieces near the bottom
of the board, we first check to see if any rows should be cleared. If so,
they are immediately removed. 
<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Atris-ColorGravity2.jpg" HSPACE=10>
Now, all of the little tiles of the same color that are adjacent to each
other (from this most recent piece or from any previously-placed piece)
"merge" together and become a cohesive unit. In our running example,
no mergers take place: the figure at left shows the same piece after it has
touched down.
<P>
<br>
<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Atris-ColorGravity3.jpg" HSPACE=10>
Then gravity takes effect, and all of the merged cohesive units fall
separately. The effect of this is that if your currently-falling piece is
made up of two colors, it will "fall into pieces" when it touches down and
those pieces will "slide past each other".  The figure at left shows
the same the upper left corner falling separately. 
<P>
<br>
<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Atris-ColorGravity4.jpg" HSPACE=10>
Such falling pieces eventually come to rest. If a piece falls like that and
just happens to fill up another row, that row is cleared and the process
repeats itself. Every row you clear as a result of placing one single piece
is summed up for the purposes of scoring and interfering with your
opponents. What this means is that you can, in fact, clear <B>more than
four lines</B> by dropping a single piece. 
<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Atris-ColorGravity5.jpg" HSPACE=10>
Finally, adjacent tiles of the same color merge again. In our runing
example, the piece that had been falling has come to rest and merges with
its lower part.
<P>

This can take a little getting used to, but it adds a lot to the game.
Watch the demo for a bit to get the hang of it. 
<P>
<A NAME="garbage">
<B>4.2 Multiplayer interference</B>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3><TR>
<TD VALIGN=CENTER>
In a multi-player game (AI players count!), if you clear 3 more or rows at
once, your opponent's screen will be obscured for a time. They can
  still move and their pieces still fall, 
but they cannot see (AI players are prevented from "thinking" but can still
"move"). If you clear 3 or more rows twice in quick succession, the "blank"
timeout extends. In the example screenshot,
the screen for the player on the right has been obscured. When the random
fill-in image reaches the bottom, the normal view returns.
<P>
If you clear 5 or more rows at once, an extra row of garbage will be added
at the bottom of your opponent's board. Ouch!
<P>
If you clear 7 or more rows at once (I've never seen this ...), your
unlucky opponent gets both the garbage and the blanking.

We are responsive to user requests, and at a beta-tester's suggestion,

    <TD>When it comes to rest, this piece pushes each tile directly

	tiles. This has the effect of taking the topmost row of pieces

<A NAME="bugs">
<B>5. Troubleshooting</B>
<P>
Tetromix is hardly perfect, although we have gone to some lengths to
assure stability and platform independence.  This section highlights
some SDL pointers, tetromix limitations and common problems.  <A
HREF="faq.html">Our tetromix FAQ</A> may also be of use. A good place to
start for general information is the <a
href="http://www.libsdl.org/faqs.html">SDL FAQ List</a> (no really:
it's useful!).  
<P>

<A NAME="windows">
<B>5.1 Under Windows</B>
<P>
A number of SDL settings are mutable via environment variables. These can
sometimes be a little tricky to set under Windows, though: check your
Control Panel.
<UL>
    <LI>You can set the environment variable "SDL_AUDIODRIVER" 
    <UL>
	<LI>dsound - (default) Use the DirectSound API</LI>
	<LI>waveout - Use the Win32 MultiMedia API</LI>
    </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI>You can set the environment variable "SDL_VIDEODRIVER" 
    <UL>
	<LI>directx - (default) Use the DirectDraw API</LI>
	<LI>windib - Use the standard Win32 GDI</LI>
    </UL>
    </LI>
</UL>

Known bugs:
<UL>
  <LI><B>Full-screen mode</B> is not well-supported. Try selecting
  "Toggle Full Screen" from the Special Options menu to see if full-screen
  mode works for you. If nothing happens, do not try to invoke full-screen
  mode from the command line: it will probably hang your system.
</UL>
<P>

If you have trouble:

<UL>
  <LI>Look in <B>stdout.txt</B> in the directory you ran tetromix.exe from to
      get an idea of what's going on.  If you can't figure it out (or
      you think it indicates a bug), please <A
      HREF="mailto:wkiri@cs.cornell.edu,weimer@cs.berkeley.edu">send
      us</A> the entire contents and a description of the problem.
</UL>


<A NAME="linux">
<B>5.2 Under Linux</B>
<P>
A number of SDL settings are mutable via environment variables.
<UL>
    <LI>You can set the environment variable "SDL_AUDIODRIVER" 
    <UL>
	<LI>dsp - (default) Use the OSS API by opening /dev/dsp</LI>
	<LI>dma - Use the OSS API to perform DMA access on /dev/dsp</LI>
	<LI>esd - Connect to the Enlightenment sound audio daemon</LI>
    </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI>You can set the environment variable "SDL_VIDEODRIVER" 
    <UL>
	<LI>x11 - (default) Use the X11 windowing system</LI>
	<LI>fbcon - Use the framegrabber console</LI>
	<LI>svga - Use the SVGAlib API</LI>
	<LI>ggi - Use the General Graphics Interface API</LI>
	<LI>aalib - Use the Ascii Art library (!?)</LI>
    </UL>
    </LI>
</UL>
    

Known bugs:
<UL>
  <LI><B>Conflict with Enlightenment's sound daemon</B>: Under some
      systems with the Enlightenment sound daemon running, the game
      will hang on startup if you try to run it while something else
      is using the sound card.  You can avoid this problem by
      <OL>
	<LI>quitting the other application or
	<LI>running tetromix with the <B>-q</B> option (to disable
	    sound).
      </OL>
</UL>
<P>

If you have trouble:

<UL>
  <LI>Look at the output on stdout. If you can't figure it out (or
      you think it indicates a bug), please <A
      HREF="mailto:wkiri@cs.cornell.edu,weimer@cs.berkeley.edu">send
      us</A> the entire contents and a description of the problem.

<A NAME="mac">
<B>5.3 Under Macintosh</B>

Known bugs:
<UL>
  <LI><B>Networking</B> will fail.  If you care about this and really
      want it supported for the Mac, <A
      HREF="mailto:wkiri@cs.cornell.edu,weimer@cs.berkeley.edu">let us
      know</A>.
</UL>
<P>

If you have trouble:

<UL>
  <LI>Find your stdout.  We think it might be in a file called
      stdout.txt. If you can't figure out what's going on (or
      you think it indicates a bug), please <A

<A NAME="create">
<B>Appendix A. Create your own styles</B>
<P>

You can make your own color, shape, and sound styles if you have a
text editor and some raw materials. Just go into the "styles/"
sub-directory and make a copy of one of the small text files there
(say, "Default.Sound" -> "Nifty.Sound"). Now edit your new copy with a
text editor and change the name ("Default Sound Scheme" -> "My Nifty
Sounds"). Then change all of the references to other files ("thud.wav"
-> "my_new_thud.wav"). Re-run Tetromix: presto! Your choice should be
visible on one of the menus. If there are any load-time problems, they
will be displayed on <A HREF="#windows">stdout</A>.

<P>
<B>Sound Styles:</B> All sound files must be 11025 Hz mono 8-bit WAV files. The
first line in the file names the style, all of the other non-comment lines
associate a WAV file with an action in the game. 
<P>
<B>Color Styles:</B> All graphic files must be 20x20 (by 24 bit) Windows-style
Bitmaps. The first line in the file is the name of the style. The second
line must contain a single integer giving the number of distinct colors
(bitmaps) defined by the file. The first bitmap will be used to display the
garbage that starts at the bottom of the screen, the remaining X-1 become
possible values for tiles in different pieces. Note that network play requires
that 
<P>
<B>Piece Styles:</B> The first line gives the name of the style, the next line
gives the number of distinct piece shapes defined by the style. After that
you must define that many individual pieces using our amazing ASCII art
notation. Each piece should be blank-separated from those before and after
it and should be square (i.e., 3x3 or 4x4 but not 4x3). 
<P>
<B>Limitations:</B> If you make any mistakes with these specification files our
highly advanced parser (cough) will notice and the game will not start.
Check for errors on <A HREF="#windows">stdout</A>. The configuration system
is not elegant but it should be quite easy.
