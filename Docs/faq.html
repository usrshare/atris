<B>Q:</B> Why does my screen saver run extremely slowly while atris is
	running?</FONT><br>
<B>A:</B> Atris contains a number of CPU-intensive computations. When
	the game is waiting for your input, it typically renders a random
	flaming background: this can dramatically limit the number of CPU
	slices given to the screen-saver. Similarly, if you have two AI
	players playing against each other, their lookahead-based
strategies
can be a drain on computing resources. Possible solutions:<UL>
	<LI>Run atris "niced" (see nice(1)), or the equivalent.</LI>
	<LI>Run atris with the "-n" no-flaming-background option.</LI>
	</UL>

<B>Q:</B> Why am I having so much trouble controlling the pieces? </FONT><br>
<B>A:</B> Atris version 1.0.5 introduced the ability to change the keyboard
    repeat rate. If you find that the pieces move or rotate too quickly for
    you, consider changing the setting from within the "Special Options"
    menu. Let us know if you have any other playability problems.

<B>Q:</B> Why is the speed at which pieces fall when they are no longer
	under a player's control so slow?</FONT><br>
<B>A:</B> Atris versions 1.0.1 and below mistakenly tied the speed of such
	pieces to the difficulty level, resulting in a "slow-motion" effect
	for falling pieces at low levels of difficulty. Atris versions
	1.0.2 and below had a bug in the routine that draws falling pieces,
	causing it to update overly large portions of the screen for extra
	bonus slowness. Beyond that, things can get slow if a large number
	of pieces are falling at the same time. Let us know if you continue
	to notice this problem.

<B>Q:</B> Every once in a while when there are two players one of the
	screens fills up with junk for a bit. What gives?</FONT><br>
<B>A:</B> What you are seeing is the <a
	href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~weimer/atris/Docs/atris.html#garbage">
	multiplayer interference</a> aspect of Atris. Basically, player A
	is seeing the "junk" because player B has done particularly well by
	clearing a large number of rows at the same time. 
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#3333AA>
<B>Q:</B> Sometimes the player seems to die before the garbage has reached
	the top of the board. Why are you so unfair?</FONT><br>
<B>A:</B> A player dies or "tops out" when the next piece cannot be placed
	at the top-center of the board at any rotation. So even if you have
	plenty of free space on the left and right edges of the board, you
	will die if you clog up the center all the way to the top.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#3333AA>
<B>Q:</B> Why doesn't the screen flip around in Atris? </FONT><BR>
<B>A:</B> Perhaps you are confusing Atris with a similar game :-). We have
	future plans for a "screen rotation" variant on the <a
	href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~weimer/atris/Docs/atris.html#garbage">
	multiplayer interference</a> aspect of Atris. As it currently
	stands, however, there is no such feature. 
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#3333AA>
<B>Q:</B> How can I make Atris look like this other tetris game I'm
thinking of?:</FONT><BR>
<B>A:</B> You might want to try turning the "Double Difficulty", "Long
Settle Delay" and "Upward Rotation" Special Options on and the "Power
Pieces" Special Option off.
