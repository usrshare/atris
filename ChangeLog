			      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.0.7 - "fewer buffer overruns"
    * Thanks to about a dozen people who pointed out some buffer overruns,
      atris now has fewer buffer overruns. :-)

Version 1.0.6 - "Delay"
    * You can now press ctrl-enter to toggle between full-screen mode 
      and normal mode. Recompile everything with a newer version of SDL,
      etc. 

Version 1.0.5 - "Donna"
    * Added an "atris.rc" preference file that saves your choices between
      runs. Special pieces are no longer on by default.
    * You may now change the keyboard repeat rate within the game. 

Version 1.0.4 - "Bill"
    * Added three special options as per Bill's request: "double
      difficulty", "long settle delay" and "upward rotation". 

Version 1.0.3 - "Olympus"
    * added four types of Power Pieces as per Yujia's request
    * factored out the opening menus so that the display is cleaner
    * the clock no longer ticks if you go into negative "overtime" ...
    * fixed a bug in the routine that draws falling pieces: it was updating
      a larger region of the screen than it should have, resulting in
      sub-optimal performance
    * license fix: we had previously included the LGPL instead of the GPL
      as the atris license ... whoops!

Version 1.0.2 - "Nirgal"
    * the sound effects are now packaged separately 

Version 1.0.1 - "Nirgal"
    * pieces now fall at a uniform fast rate when you cannot control them
	(i.e., when things slide after your piece has dropped)
    * you may now enter a starting level for new players
    * the game is more fair about placing pieces near the the top of the
	board
    * you may now select the AI difficulty

Version 1.0.0 - "Nirgal"
    * First out-of-house beta. 
    * Cross-platform compatibility: Win32 and Unix, provided you use SDL.
    * Multiple Styles: pieces, colors, sounds, etc. 
    * Multiple Modes: single or multiple player, computer players, network
    	play, etc. Special AI vs. AI deathmatch mode just for kicks. :-)
    * It should crash on you less often than previous versions.
