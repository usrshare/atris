			      Alizarin Tetris
			      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			  Version 1.0.7 - "fewer buffer overruns"

This is a Linux/Win32 version of the classic Tetris game, but with a twist
related to gravity and block colors. Getting it to run on your system is a
Two Step Process :-). 

		Step 1 - Obtain It
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're reading this file, you've already mastered this step. Just in
case, check out
	http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~weimer/atris/

		Step 2 - Method A - Win32 Binary
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UnZip the file (atris-1.0.7-win32.zip) in some directory (e.g., "C:\Program
Files\"). It will make its own "atris" subdirectory. You're done. Use
Windows Explorer (or somesuch) to run the "atris.exe" file in that
directory. 

Optional: UnZip the file (atris-sounds-1.0.1-win32.zip) in the same
directory (e.g., "C:\Program Files\"). Now you'll have neato sound effects. 

		Step 2 - Method B - Linux Binary RPM
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download and install (rpm -i) the following RPMs:
	freetype-1.3.1-1.i386.rpm	(or newer, but not version 2)
	SDL-1.1.6-1.i386.rpm		(or newer)
	SDL_ttf-1.2.2-1.i386.rpm	(or newer)

Then proceed to Method C. 

		Step 2 - Method C - Use The Source
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download, unpack, configure, make, make install (unless you already have them):
	freetype-1.3.1.tar.gz		(or newer, but not version 2)
	SDL-1.1.6.tar.gz		(or newer)
	SDL_ttf-1.2.2.tar.gz		(or newer)

Then download and unpack, configure, make and install:

	atris-1.0.5.tar.gz		(or newer)
	atris-sounds-1.0.1.tar.gz	(or newer, optional)

I have successfully built the atris source on x86-linux natively and using
the mingwin unix->win32 cross compiler. Every effort has been made to make
it portable across platforms.
	
		You're Done!
		~~~~~~~~~~~~
Atris does take some command line arguments, use "atris -h" to get a list.
Note that under Win32, all the output goes to "stdout.txt".

See "Docs/atris.html" for instructions on actually playing the game and
strategy hints.
