Alizarin Tetris also uses:
 o  The magical SDL library by Sam Lantinga, available under the LGPL at:
	http://www.libsdl.org
    It took a little getting used to, but it's actually quite fast and the
    cross-platform features are really nice. Go Sam!

 o  The useful SDL_ttf library which is based on the freetype true-type
    font rendering engine. See http://www.libsdl.org for details. 

 o  "fastrand.cpp", a fast random number generator from the Maelstrom game,
    available under the GPL at:
	http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/Maelstrom/

 o  "xflame.c", which draws those popular flaming backgrounds, freeware
    from The Rasterman (Carsten Haitzler). 

 o  The Squarish Sans CT font by Tim Larson, licensed under the terms
    of the Open Font License and available at:
    http://christtrekker.users.sourceforge.net/fnt/squarishsans.shtml

Special thanks to:
 o  Yujia Jin, our first beta-tester.
